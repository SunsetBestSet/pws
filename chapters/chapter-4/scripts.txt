Hiko: Wow!! Look at all those cool trees!
Kana(happy): Those are yorishiro , we only have a few of them in the capital. They're traditional to Kewon culture and sacred to our religion. 
Hiko: So cool! And what does that rope mean?
Kana: The ropes show us those trees are sacred and are inhabited by good spirits. Cutting one of the trees brings misfortune.
Hiko: Oh wow! Ghosts! In trees!
Leiko: Ugh, Kana, you're so embarrassing. I can't believe you're telling him that. I'm sure it's not even true.
Kana: They are not lies, Leiko. As a royal, you should know these things if you attended the ancestral rituals from time to time. These objects are part of our past and are sacred to the core of our being.
Irene: Enough bickering. We should find out how to get up the mountain the quickest. 

A random villager (excited): Hey, isn't that princess Leiko and crown-princess Kana?! What are they doing here?!

Irene (annoyed): No. Now carry on with your life.
Leiko: OK. So how do we get there...
Hiko: LOOOOOKKK!!! I see Satoru's shop in the distance! Maybe he can help!
Irene: That's not Satoru's shop Hiko. It's just another shop. Not all shops are run by Satoru.
Hiko: It is! I recognize it from our village!
Irene: No Hiko. It's not. Now shut up.
Hiko: Okay...
Leiko: Maybe the local shopkeeper can tell us something about how we can get to the mountain!
Kana: *coughing loudly* I can go take a look...
Leiko: ...are you okay Kana?
Kana: Yeah. I'm fine. Just stay here, I'm going. *sneezes*
Leiko: Okay, well stay safe Kana!
Hiko: Bye Kana! Good luck!!!
Irene: Stay safe.
Leiko: WAITTTT I WANNA COME WITH YOU
Kana: Okay, just follow after me
Kana (thinking): Okay, time to go to the shop.
